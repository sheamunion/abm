__Clinical Expertise__ – The regulatory path for an Aesthetic product is rarely a straight line from R&D to market access; it is usually a meandering process that will rapidly distort your straight line into a tortured journey that
punishes the inexperienced. ABM has at its disposal a host of plastic and reconstructive surgeons, dermatologists,
manufacturer's regulatory obligations and aestheticians of whom work in the Aesthetics field on a daily basis treating hundreds of patient each week. We know what will work and what won’t. We know what patents want and the experience they want to receive it in.

__Regulatory Knowhow__ – Aesthetics BioMedical has regulatory and quality experts on staff, right here and right now. Not expensive consultants or outside experts who may or may not be available, but team members who get their hands dirty every day working on Aesthetics products. If you want to forecast the unforeseen complications or simplify clarify those daunting complexities, Aesthetics BioMedical has the regulatory team involved from the start in research and development; right through pre-clinical testing, clinical testing, and guiding the post market clinical follow up. They are the guardians of ABM’s integrity, keenly focused on doing the right thing at the right time; keeping each project on time and under budget.

__Integrity__ – It is in the vanguard of everything we do and demonstrated in every action we take. It never costs too much or takes too much time. Our clients, our partners, the third party laboratories we work with, the investigators who conduct research, the statisticians who crunch our data, the regulators who oversee us, and most importantly our patients trust ABM to always do the right thing.
