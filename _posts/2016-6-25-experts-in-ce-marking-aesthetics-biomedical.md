One medical device directive became two, then three, and then related ones were introduced. Today more than a dozen directives potentially apply to your device, service or drug; not to mention Harmonized Standards, European Pharmacopoeial Methods, Common Technical Specifications, MEDDEVs and being under the constant supervision of a notified body.

__IN 2014__, thanks to those dedicated executives at the French PIP Breast Implant Company, a whole of host process manufacturer's regulatory obligations changes were introduced including mandatory supplier audits, unannounced notified body audits, more rigorous design dossier review, increased emphasis on risk management, and the introduction of post market clinical follow up. Once again companies wanting the CE Mark, or wanting to keep using the CE Mark, stumbled through new requirements, unannounced inspections, and other changes they did not even know were coming!

__ABM’s__ regulatory team has a keen appreciation of the complexities of CE Marking. However we have reduced it to just another process – a linear process with dozens of stages and in each stage there may be 1000’s of potential actions, but only one right choice. ABM has the clinical experience and regulatory knowhow to consistently make the right choice. By doing it once and doing it right we are able to shrink time to market; minimize expenses and just as Edwards Deming promised ABM continually improves its products, its services, the experience we offer, and the outcome each patient enjoys.

> It is not necessary to change.
> Survival is not mandatory.

__ABM__ has another advantage; we know that for CE Marking — __everything is about to change__. The three principal medical device directives are about to become two medical device regulations. ISO 13485:2003 the backbone of every company’s CE Marking compliance has become ISO 13485:2016 with a more than a dozen changes to that Standard alone. ABM has already implemented these changes nearly two years ahead of schedule.
