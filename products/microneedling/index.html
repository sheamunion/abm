				<br>
				<p>
					Microneedling is one of the top-ten, most-searched topics in aesthetics. Microneedling (also known as collagen induction therapy) is a minimally invasive treatment to rejuvenate the skin. A device with fine needles creates tiny punctures in the top layer of the skin that stimulates the body to create new collagen and elastin.
				</p>

				<p>
					The needles are used to puncture the skin to create a controlled skin injury. Each puncture creates a channel that stimulates the body to fill these microscopic wounds by producing new collagen and elastin. Through the process of neovascularization and neocollagenesis, there is improvement in skin texture and firmness, as well as reduction in scars, pore size and stretch marks.
				</p>

				<p>
					Microneedling is a safe, chemical-free treatment to trigger new collagen. When combined with radio frequency, it becomes the newest revolution in contouring and tightening for the face, neck and body, producing amazing results and little downtime. The addition of the right products as part of the treatment process ensures desired outcomes.
				</p>

				<p>
					As opposed to microneedling rollers and pens that can lead to tearing, pain and variable patient results, The Vivace’s needle sets contain 36 insulated, gold-tipped needles set to deliver comfortable results at many levels of penetration. Setting The Vivace apart from the competition are a number of design decisions made in the best interest of patient results and patient comfort.
				</p>

				<p>
					Additionally, The Vivace is one of the few devices to have earned FDA clearance, which is critically important in today’s increasingly stringent regulatory climate. The Vivace, a best-in-class, RF microneedling device that combines this sought after treatment, paired radio frequency and state-of-the-art treatment serums and recovery systems make The Vivace Experience&#8482; an incomparable patient experience.
