        <h3>NUMBING</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Pinnacle Numbing Cream</strong> is the best numbing cream in the industry. This excellent quality, patient-centered numbing cream is core to The Vivace Experience as it reduces pain for a more relaxing experience. With a Versapro Base and a combination of Benzocaine, Lidocaine and/or Tetracaine, we work with Pinnacle Compounding to mill a cream that does not run or melt as the patient goes through the numbing process. Highly effective for our patients, even at the highest settings of The Vivace, many have reported to feel very little to no pain.
