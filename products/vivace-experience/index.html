        <h3>NUMBING</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Personalized Compounded Numbing Cream</strong> is the best numbing cream in the industry. This excellent quality, patient-centered numbing cream is core to The Vivace Experience&#8482; as it reduces pain for a more relaxing experience. With a Versapro Base and a combination of Benzocaine, Lidocaine and/or Tetracaine, we mill a cream that does not run or melt as the patient goes through the numbing process. Highly effective for our patients, even at the highest settings of The Vivace, many have reported to feel very little to no pain.

This comfort factor increases patient compliance and results with painless reapplication and reduces the time the patient’s skin is exposed to painful open air. Less pain reduces calls to the physicians’ offices regarding pain management. Patients enjoy this product and tend to refer others as a result of having less pain. In the end, Soothe Recovery Balm creates better quality, appearance and texture of the skin. This product is core to The Vivace Experience&#8482; Soothe Recovery System.
