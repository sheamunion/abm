 				<h2>PATIENT TESTIMONIALS</h2>
 				<h3 class="margin-bottom-1">Here’s What Real Clients Are Saying About The Vivace Experience&#8482;</h3>
				<p class="margin-bottom-25">
					“I had the 'Vivace Experience' about a month ago and was thrilled! I’ve had other microneedling procedures before, but wasn’t sure what to expect with this device. The clinician asked me several times during the process to report my pain level between 1 and 5. Repeatedly I had difficulty answering because most of the time I wasn’t feeling anything that I would label as pain, despite the fact that she had put the machine on its maximum settings. Immediately following the treatment, I went out to dinner (without makeup) and friends were commenting on how great my skin looked. In the weeks since, I’ve noted positive changes and feel that the benefits of The Vivace seem to be much greater than what I’ve experienced in the past with regular microneedling.”

					“I have been fastidious about my complexion for many years. I’ve tried all manner of lotions, potions, creams, cleansers and such. Then I discovered the miracle machine, The Vivace. Thirty minutes of Vivace treatment followed by the recommended post treatment products called The Vivace Experience&#8482; has given me weeks of youthful, glowing skin. It all happened so fast, too. About 30 minutes after my treatment, I was having lunch on a restaurant patio. It brings a smile to my face every time I look at my driver’s license photo. Even my granddaughters are jealous. I will use Vivace again and again.”

					“My Vivace experience made me a believer that the microneedling technology and specially formulated skincare products are a safe, effective, affordable treatment to stimulate new collagen growth and reverse the appearance of aging and scarring. I particularly wanted to reduce facial acne scars, and I think the Vivace may be the answer I’ve been looking for. With one treatment I walked out looking noticeably better even without makeup.”

				<p class="margin-bottom-25">
					"I'm glad I chose Vivace! I was a little nervous as friends have had pain during other kinds of microneedling treatments, but I found this treatment to be a breeze. On a scale of one to ten, I was at a one during the majority of the treatment. I was blown away how little I felt. One hour later, fine lines appeared to be diminished, my lips had a nice, little pout and I was ready to get back to my day and see people with no makeup. The tightening made me feel great about myself. I plan to do a series of three, and I can't wait for the next one!"

					“I rarely review or give testimonials, however, I thought I'd give The Vivace system a try and share my experience. I am not fond of needles, even if they are so small, so I was a bit apprehensive before my procedure. The numbing cream works wonders and is applied about 30 minutes prior. I was made to feel quite comfortable and throughout the whole procedure I felt little or no pain. As a performer, I sing in the Classic Rock Band, ASIA, I get very picky about my appearance. Photographs and videos can exaggerate the effect of time! However immediately afterwards I felt invigorated. Over the next few days I saw a difference in improvement of fine lines and a much more uniform skin tone. Yes, it works for men, too. I will be back for more.”

					“My Vivace treatments left my face feeling energized and looking awesome. Lines decreased, and my skin remains tight and clear; and it is almost one year later. Thank you Vivace!”

					“Thus far our office has had great success implementing The Vivace microneedling device. We have found that it fills the void between an invasive fractional laser and transcutaneous delivery of radio frequency. We love the fact that all skin types can be treated in all seasons. Our patients have found the downtime to be minimal if any. Our satisfaction rates are as high as any new device that I've ever seen. So far it's a homerun.”

          "Vivace RF microneedling has revolutionized the way I treat patients at Fusion Medical Spa &amp; Wellness in Ruidoso, NM. Patients that we have treated with the Vivace system continue to send in friends and family based on their own great results. It’s great to be able to plan a procedure without trying to factor in downtime! I went to a public event within 1 hour of my first treatment and looked great. My patients and I all enjoy looking in the mirror or at the before and after pictures and admiring the results!"
