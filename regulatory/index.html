        <p>
          The aesthetics industry has been pushing the boundary between medicine and cosmetics for several years. Interventions and procedures that contribute to people leading better, more fulfilling lives have reached the point where smart regulatory/quality management is now a necessity. There is no grandfathering of products, and no such category as cosmeceutical.  Companies must adequately and carefully manage the regulatory/quality maze for their products, both old and new. If you are in the Aesthetic business and are successful at it, you are probably offering for sale medical devices or in some cases biologics and pharmaceuticals.

          This new landscape will do one of two things very quickly: become a black hole into which your company will throw millions of dollars to obtain nothing and lose marketshare; or it will become an instrument that will catapult you to greater marketshare with a level of cost competiveness your competition will wish they had.
        </p>
        <p>
          The regulatory/quality requirements companies now face introduces concepts and heightened burdens the industry has never previously had to negotiate–design control, risk management, pre-clinical testing, clinical testing, post-market clinical follow-up and a host of other requirements for every product it sells, new or old.   As look into your own regulatory needs you will quickly realize there are more than 20,000 possible processes, procedures, standards, guidance documents, treaties or other requirements on your journey to clearance, however, you may only need only a few of them.

        <p>
          Without sound regulatory skills, policies and procedures, even companies with long and distinguished product lines are at risk for extinction. Every aesthetics company, no matter size or past success, must meet the same set of regulatory requirements.

ABM’s in-house regulatory and quality teams have more than 50 years combined experience with USFDA, Health Canada and EU CE Marking market access.
